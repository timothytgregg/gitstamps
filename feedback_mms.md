Overall:

I'm impressed. Good solid work, with obvious stretch areas.  There is a lot of code here.  You did great with the time you had.  I heard great things all week long.  It shows.  I see evidence of branches (and merge conflicts).  Specs!?!  Sweet. Sometimes, it's the little things.  Like an updated .gitignore.

You should be very proud of your work.
